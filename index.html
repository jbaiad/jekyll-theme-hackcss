<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi there! I'm Josh and I'm a quantitative researcher and developer.</p>

<p>I currently work on AQR's risk parity research team. I previously worked as 
a consultant for onTREND, a trend-following hedge fund based out of Toronto, 
where I designed and led the development of their proprietary trading platform.
I've since been an advisor to onTREND, providing direction for long-term 
technical and research goals.</p>

<p>I was educated at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied mathematics,
logic, and computer science.</p>
