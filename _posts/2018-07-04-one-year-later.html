<p>A year ago today, I stepped off a plane that departed from Narita airport in
Tokyo and returned to the US after several months in Asia. I arrived in
Washington D.C., where I picked up a transfer back to Pittsburgh to grab  my
things and say goodbye to the people and place I called my home for the previous
four years. Then, my friend and I packed his car with my life's possessions
(everything fit into two boxes!) and we drove off to New York City, where I'd
begin my first foray into the "real world".</p>

<p>I grew up in the shadow of New York City and the financial industry. I was born
in Danbury, Connecticut and raised in the neighboring town of Brookfield--a
quiet and relatively barren place. It was always my dream to move to New York
and work in the financial industry, which, in retrospect, sounds like an
incredibly naive and silly thing to want. I suppose it was my sense of pride
that drove me to it: I always wanted to be perceived as intelligent and I wanted
money, and having grown up in pre-2008 Connecticut, quantitative finance seemed
like the shortest path to those things. Now, I'm not so sure what I want, but I
suppose that's also part of the journey of young adulthood.</p>

<p>After having worked at one of the largest quantitative money managers in the
world, I've learned that quantitative finance is, as with technology,
not nearly as interesting or complex as the recruiters or institutional
salesmen would like you to believe. The reality is that most of what they do is
well-studied and public knowledge--perhaps this is why very few hedge funds
actually manage to consistently beat the market.</p>

<p>I used to worry that I would never be able to work on something as interesting
or intellectually challenging as I was once able to while at Carnegie Mellon.
However, I've since found that working on arbitrarily difficult proofs or
fetishizing new technologies is significantly less interesting than
understanding a client's problem and navigating the hurdles to solve it for
them. In short, having impact is significantly more interesting and satisfying
than engaging in the sort of intellectual masturbation I became accustomed to
while completing my undergraduate degree. Though, maybe this is simply the
evolution of my pride: I used to want to be intelligent, but now I want to be
important.</p>
